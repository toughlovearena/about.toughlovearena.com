Everyone has also been slightly slowed down / brought closer together to help prevent faster characters running away</li><li>Throw avoid: Walking forward to avoid throws is admittedly strange, but we&#x27;re trying it out for a reason. It&#x27;s simple, stays in the spirit of throws (they only work on blocking), and fixes the difficult scenario of consistently avoiding Caber Toss (just hold forward)</li><li>Throw ranges: These been expanded in proportion to walk speed.

By making the RC worse, the strength is dialed back a bit, while keeping the chip setups. Spike was buffed to make it more appealing as a combo ender</li><li>Pork has the same Palm and Spike changes as Beef. Caber Toss is meant to be unaffected by the Throw Change, as the 50/50 of meaty attack or toss still works if the opponent holds forward to escape the throw (instead of perfectly timing an attack)</li><li>Onion&#x27;s Sweep has had the recovery reduced to make it less risky to whiff.

To address (1), we reduced the risk and reward across the board, reducing the time to punish but also reducing the max damage possible. This should make people more willing to go for parries, while making the attacker less afraid of them. For (2), we decided to make the parry timing much stricter and universal (first 5 frames). This allows us to open it up for anti-air use (not trivial to use), adds a skill check, and helps distinguish it from Frenzy and Chop with their long armor frames. We are sad to remove the &quot;custom combo&quot; nature of Onion&#x27;s parry, and are open to restoring it in the future if we can find another elegant way to cap the max damage. Lastly, unrelated to these parry changes, Sneak has been given a little chip to make it more viable at high level play as an option, and to encourage players to more proactively try to anti-air it.</li></ul></div><div><a class="Changelog_anchor__8Wfat" id="0.47.5"></a><div class="Changelog_version__t3nxC"><a class="Changelog_patch__Ly7ta" href="#0.47.5">0.47.5</a><span class="Changelog_date__MyQG8">2021/04/26</span></div><ul><li>Animation: Added back in screen shake as a setting you can enable in Options (turned off by default)</li><li>Menu: Parry frames are now counted as Active frames, and other misc cleanup on the Frame Data menu</li><li>Canary: Modified UI to better identify footage from a Canary build</li></ul></div><div><a class="Changelog_anchor__8Wfat" id="0.47.4"></a><div class="Changelog_version__t3nxC"><a class="Changelog_patch__Ly7ta" href="#0.47.4">0.47.4</a><span class="Changelog_date__MyQG8">2021/04/24</span></div><ul><li>Animation: Updated Whip, Gutpunch, and Sweep animation to better match their hitboxes</li><li>About: Added link to the new events page: <a href="http://events.toughlovearena.com">events.toughlovearena.com</a></li></ul></div><div><a class="Changelog_anchor__8Wfat" id="0.47.3"></a><div class="Changelog_version__t3nxC"><a class="Changelog_patch__Ly7ta" href="#0.47.3">0.47.3</a><span class="Changelog_date__MyQG8">2021/04/23</span></div><ul><li>Menu: Added a few solutions for common network problems to the FAQ</li><li>Menu: Fixed bug where you could not Emote using the keyboard on a few menus</li><li>Training: Separated settings for P1 vs P2 blocking, with P1 defaulting to Enabled and P2 defaulting to Auto</li><li>Maintenance: Added stats to track usage of Block List</li></ul></div><div><a class="Changelog_anchor__8Wfat" id="0.47.2"></a><div class="Changelog_version__t3nxC"><a class="Changelog_patch__Ly7ta" href="#0.47.2">0.47.2</a><span class="Changelog_date__MyQG8">2021/04/17</span></div><ul><li>Online: Added &quot;Block List&quot; to Casual Match</li><li>&gt; You can now block players for 24 hours at the match confirmation screen</li><li>&gt; This allows you to stop endlessly rematching against the same opponent</li><li>&gt; You must be logged in to block.

These are some of those smaller changes after being further tuned. Noodle&#x27;s buff isn&#x27;t large, but is merely meant to give Noodle more interesting options in an existing scenario. Pork currently feels very feast or famine when it comes to matchups, so the Chop changes are intended to make them less polarizing. The new slide should help in the difficult Noodle/Rice matchup (making it easier to armor through Whip), but hurt in the easy Onion/Garlic matchup (Chop is now easier to punish on a close block/whiff). Lastly, Garlic buff is a correction, partially undoing the 0.41.0 nerf that went too far. It should still be punishable by every character&#x27;s Heavy, but only at point-blank.

To address (1), we reduced the risk and reward across the board, reducing the time to punish but also reducing the max damage possible. This should make people more willing to go for parries, while making the attacker less afraid of them. For (2), we decided to make the parry timing much stricter and universal (first 5 frames). This allows us to open it up for anti-air use (not trivial to use), adds a skill check, and helps distinguish it from Frenzy and Chop with their long armor frames. We are sad to remove the \"custom combo\" nature of Onion's parry, and are open to restoring it in the future if we can find another elegant way to cap the max damage. Lastly, unrelated to these parry changes, Sneak has been given a little chip to make it more viable at high level play as an option, and to encourage players to more proactively try to anti-air it."]},{"v":"0.47.5","date":"2021/04/26","notes":["Animation: Added back in screen shake as a setting you can enable in Options (turned off by default)","Menu: Parry frames are now counted as Active frames, and other misc cleanup on the Frame Data menu","Canary: Modified UI to better identify footage from a Canary build"]},{"v":"0.47.4","date":"2021/04/24","notes":["Animation: Updated Whip, Gutpunch, and Sweep animation to better match their hitboxes","About: Added link to the new events page: events.toughlovearena.com"]},{"v":"0.47.3","date":"2021/04/23","notes":["Menu: Added a few solutions for common network problems to the FAQ","Menu: Fixed bug where you could not Emote using the keyboard on a few menus","Training: Separated settings for P1 vs P2 blocking, with P1 defaulting to Enabled and P2 defaulting to Auto","Maintenance: Added stats to track usage of Block List"]},{"v":"0.47.2","date":"2021/04/17","notes":["Online: Added \"Block List\" to Casual Match","\u003e You can now block players for 24 hours at the match confirmation screen","\u003e This allows you to stop endlessly rematching against the same opponent","\u003e You must be logged in to block.

Pork currently feels very feast or famine when it comes to matchups, so the Chop changes are intended to make them less polarizing. The new slide should help in the difficult Noodle/Rice matchup (making it easier to armor through Whip), but hurt in the easy Onion/Garlic matchup (Chop is now easier to punish on a close block/whiff). Lastly, Garlic buff is a correction, partially undoing the 0.41.0 nerf that went too far. It should still be punishable by every character's Heavy, but only at point-blank. As for the other characters, we are still evaluating changes for Rice and Beef that are simply not ready at this time, and Onion is getting an indirect buff from the new meter rules."]},{"v":"0.46.5","date":"2021/04/10","notes":["Menu: Moved player count to bottom left as part of prep for Ranked","Tutorial: Added Multi-Slap to Noodle/Rice Character Guides"]},{"v":"0.46.4","date":"2021/04/08","notes":["Mobile: Tabbing out to a different app/page will now mute the volume until tabbing back in","Lobby: Host message now has a max character limit of 30 to prevent breaking the UI","Lobby: Fixed bug where no music would play in the Lobby screen after finishing a match","Stats: Fixed bug where global stats could appear as decimals","Win Screen: Improved issue with random \"dead pixels\" that would appear on the win screen"]},{"v":"0.46.3","date":"2021/04/06","notes":["Animation: Screen shake has been reverted","\u003e After mixed feedback from players, we are looking to make it more contextual + add the ability to disable it entirely"]},{"v":"0.46.2","date":"2021/04/06","notes":["Animation: Added screen shake on hitstop"]},{"v":"0.46.1","date":"2021/04/05","notes":["Finish cleaning up April Fools code and assets","Created aprilfools.toughlovearena.com","\u003e This is a standalone version of the Aprils Fools patch, preserved for posterity","\u003e This version does not have Online and will not be updated"]},{"v":"0.46.0","date":"2021/04/03","notes":["April Fools patch has been reverted"]},{"v":"0.45.5","date":"2021/04/02","notes":["Lobby: Added fullscreen, sound toggle, and version display to Lobby view"]},{"v":"0.45.4","date":"2021/04/02","notes":["Lobby: Added free-text message so host can communicate rules"]},{"v":"0.45.3","date":"2021/04/02","notes":["Lobby: Added button to show/hide the ID to help streamers prevent unwanted guests from joining"]},{"v":"0.45.2","date":"2021/04/02","notes":["Mobile: Reverted changes made to touch controls in 0.44.5 until a fix is found for user reported bugs"]},{"v":"0.45.1","date":"2021/04/01","notes":["Online: Fixed bug where the Emote button wasn't showing up during Character Select","Training: Adjusted random block logic to improves randomness during a block string"]},{"v":"0.45.0","date":"2021/04/01","notes":["April Fools patch!","Balance changes have been made for all six characters","A few Easter Eggs have been thrown in as well","Character Tutorials, Frame Data, and Debug Ref have been temporarily disabled.
