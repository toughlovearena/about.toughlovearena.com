      - "How to Play: Strategy and combo sections related to the above changes have been updated"
      - 'Modding: Added "snapTowards" to AttackConfig'
      - --- Explanation ---
      - Armor now works as originally intended and in a fashion more similar to other games
      - Damage nerfed overall for Noodle/Rice since they are still so strong in neutral + we want damage in general to trend down
      - Whip's new hitbox should make combos easier while keeping Whip's weakness to air attacks
      - Frenzy has been reworked to have (generally) less reward on hit, allowing us to restore it's antiair armor
      - Frenzy's juggle rework is in prepartion for more Noodle changes coming soon!
      - Whip Cross was giving Rice a little too much positioning flexibility and caused problems with the new armor change, so it was removed
      - Whip Back gives Rice more decisions to make (corner or damage?) and buffs the overall damage of Rice's meterless antiair
      - Simplified Swat and Spike to function as 1 attack (1 scaling, 100 meter, etc)
      - Palm hard knockdown gives more options for how to end certain midscreen combos and prevents an issue with the new Chop cancel
      - Palm > Chop lets Pork confirm a grounded combo into meterless oki at the cost of damage
      - Chop's travel distance increased to make Palm > Chop hit reliably

    notes:
      - "Buffed Onion: Cackle has been redesigned to lead to more combo opportunities"
      - Cackle now attacks 10 frames after the parry freeze with a lightning bolt, dealing 100 damage and leaving Onion +12 on hit to continue a custom combo at close range
      - Cackle has the same freeze/startup timing as Beef's Flex, making it viable as an anti-air attack (though still difficult to time)
      - Cackle's animation has been adjusted to fit this new timing and make the lightning bolt more visible
      - Cackle's attack reaches far, has no pushback on hit, deals 100 damage / 50 chip, and is safe (though minus) on block
      - Cackle's meter gain on activation has been reduced 200 > 100 (though the followup attack now adds 100 meter on hit)
      - Cackle is vulnerable before the lightning bolt, so you still want to parry multiple times against Frenzy and other multi-hit attacks
      - Cackle's attack hits once, but acts like 5 attacks for scaling (the followup combo will do much lower damage than normal)
      - 'Modding: Added "addScaling" to AttackConfig'

      - "Nerfed Garlic: Removed cancel options off Backflip"
      - "How to Play: Updated Tutorials and Combo Trials"
      - --- Explanation ---
      - "Walk speed: Carbs were always meant to be slower than Meats, and this is fixing an oversight. Everyone has also been slightly slowed down / brought closer together to help prevent faster characters running away"
      - "Throw avoid: Walking forward to avoid throws is admittedly strange, but we're trying it out for a reason. It's simple, stays in the spirit of throws (they only work on blocking), and fixes the difficult scenario of consistently avoiding Caber Toss (just hold forward)"
      - "Throw ranges: These been expanded in proportion to walk speed. This is to help slower characters successfully throw faster characters before they can walk out of range"
      - Noodle has had their damage capability and corner carry nerfed. In exchange, they gained more zoning tools
      - Rice has also lost the Whip loops, but retained big damage via Swat. Swipe has been split off of Swat and tuned to be a viable attack in neutral. Rice can also now can force a guessing game by choosing to cancel into Swipe or Swat after landing a Whip
      - Beef's Palm attack got a little too strong in 0.41.0 with the RAPID addition. By making the RC worse, the strength is dialed back a bit, while keeping the chip setups. Spike was buffed to make it more appealing as a combo ender
      - Pork has the same Palm and Spike changes as Beef. Caber Toss is meant to be unaffected by the Throw Change, as the 50/50 of meaty attack or toss still works if the opponent holds forward to escape the throw (instead of perfectly timing an attack)
      - Onion's Sweep has had the recovery reduced to make it less risky to whiff. Hopkick has been changed to a grounded attack to make the Noodle/Rice matchups less swingy. The walk speed change has made Roundhouse conversions more situational. When they get in, they should be just as strong as before
      - Garlic's Dash has been reworked under the hood to work the same as before with the new, shorter Sweep. Backflip cancels were a niche tool and were removed to make meaty situations simpler for the opponent

      - "Buffed Garlic: Sneak now does 20 chip damage on block"
      - 'NOTES: We have been unsatisfied with the Parry mechanic thus far because (1) the risk/reward was too high, making matches too random and (2) it overlapped too much in function with Armor moves (Frenzy and Chop). To address (1), we reduced the risk and reward across the board, reducing the time to punish but also reducing the max damage possible. This should make people more willing to go for parries, while making the attacker less afraid of them. For (2), we decided to make the parry timing much stricter and universal (first 5 frames). This allows us to open it up for anti-air use (not trivial to use), adds a skill check, and helps distinguish it from Frenzy and Chop with their long armor frames. We are sad to remove the "custom combo" nature of Onion''s parry, and are open to restoring it in the future if we can find another elegant way to cap the max damage. Lastly, unrelated to these parry changes, Sneak has been given a little chip to make it more viable at high level play as an option, and to encourage players to more proactively try to anti-air it.'

      - "Buffed Garlic: Backflip now travels slightly further"
      - "NOTES: The recent April Fools patch had a lot of wacky stuff, but some of the changes were experiment balance tweaks. These are some of those smaller changes after being further tuned. Noodle's buff isn't large, but is merely meant to give Noodle more interesting options in an existing scenario. Pork currently feels very feast or famine when it comes to matchups, so the Chop changes are intended to make them less polarizing. The new slide should help in the difficult Noodle/Rice matchup (making it easier to armor through Whip), but hurt in the easy Onion/Garlic matchup (Chop is now easier to punish on a close block/whiff). Lastly, Garlic buff is a correction, partially undoing the 0.41.0 nerf that went too far. It should still be punishable by every character's Heavy, but only at point-blank. As for the other characters, we are still evaluating changes for Rice and Beef that are simply not ready at this time, and Onion is getting an indirect buff from the new meter rules."

      - Fixed Lemon and Swat cancels to be marked as Recovery frames (vs Startup frames) so you can now punish them with throws
      - 'NOTES: With the recent addition of "Indecisive Lemon" (aka empty cancel), we are trying to change Lemon from a high risk, high reward move to something that more actively shapes Beef''s neutral. Watching match footage, we like that Beef players are using Lemon more, and the feints can be exciting! But we think the risk/reward is now too rewarding. Therefore, we have decreased Lemon''s strength slightly, while trying to keep all the core play patterns. Lemon at close range will still easily combo and be advantageous on block, but reducing chip and stun overall should make approaching Beef a little less difficult'

  - v: 0.39.8
    date: 2021/01/31
    notes:
      - Added distance based matchmaking!
      - When you enter CASUAL MATCH, the server guesses your location based on your IP address
      - You start with a small search range that expands every few seconds
      - By 25 seconds, you should reach max range, and start matching with anyone
      - You will match with someone when you fit inside their search range, and vice versa
      - For temporary debugging purposes, you will briefly see your distance on the calibration screen
      - If you wait longer than 35 seconds, your size on the map will start growing to help you find a match
      - If you are far from all other current players, you will become more likely to match the longer you wait
      - If you find yourself matched with someone from outside of your current search range, it's because they've been waiting a long time. This is not a bug :)
      - The algorithm is a bit more complicated than we've explained here, but these are the basic rules
      - Please give this a try and let us know if the matchmaking feels better or worse!
  - v: 0.39.7

    notes:
